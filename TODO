    We can't delete files without direct access to the remote server.
This may be considered as a bug but it may also prevent stupid things
from happening. Full-sync won't be achieved with rsync anyway, so having
such a functionality will require to break the almost non-existent
dependencies of derpbox or will require hack-ish ways to detect if
something was deleted on purpose by the user and not because the user
updated an outdated folder with missing files.

    A notification system would be nice but we can't require everyone to
have notify-send. Research shall be done.
